      <h4>The Danakil Depression</h4>The Danakil Depression is the geologically the lowest place in Africa, which lies approximately 125 meters below sea level. The Depression was formed due to Africa and Asia seperating, causing rifting and volcanic activity.
      This area is a must-see, if you are interested in seeing live volcanos, hot springs, and the Yellow Lake shown above.

      <h4>Lalibela</h4>If you want to take a time machine to the medieval civilizations of Ethiopia, Lalibela is your scene! The main attraction in Lalibela is the Church of St. George, which was built in the late 12th century AD. The underground church is
      looked at as a marvel of construction by historians due to its articulate designs in both the interior and exterior of the building. The Church is a main attraction in the country, due to it being one of the last stone-cut monolithic churches.

      the wet and dry seasons of Ethiopia. Historically, the surrounding areas of the area were used to produce lime stone which contributed to the early construction of infrastructure in the area.
